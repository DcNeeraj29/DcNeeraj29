👋 Hi, I’m @DcNeeraj29

👀 About Me

Passionate about technology and automation, I thrive on solving real-world problems through code. I am currently diving deep into data science and exploring Python and frameworks to build efficient and scalable applications. With a strong inclination toward automation, I love creating scripts that simplify everyday tasks and enhance productivity.

Outside of coding, I have a creative side—I am also a music producer who enjoys experimenting with sound and rhythm.
